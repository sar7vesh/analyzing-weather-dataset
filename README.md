### Project Overview

 I worked with a csv file that contained weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Applying all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data.


### Learnings from the project

 1. Dataframe slicing
2. Dataframe aggregation
3. Pivot table operations
4. Data Wrangling
